This is a standalone test program for the droplet finder (part of 
ioc/common/unixCam).

The droplet finder is implemented as a plugin for a genSub record.  So
here we fake an EPICS genSub record just enough so that we can test
the droplet finder.  A configuration file is read to find the plugin and
set up the run environment.

There are two modes of running:
    - If given an XTC basename and an output basename, we run on
      all of the events in the file and create a new output file.
      It is assumed that the XTC file contains an image and potentially
      a few EPICS PVs.  The existing PVs are erased and replaced by
      new position PVs: DX1, DY1, DX2, and DY2.
    - If given an XTC basename and a CHUNK:OFFSET location tuple,
      we read that single L1Accept datagram and run on it.  The
      results of the run are written into several files:
	- droplets contains the two droplet locations along with a strength.
	- image_data.ppm is the raw image.
	- bgimage1.ppm and bgimage2.ppm are the scratch images.
	- xproj1, xproj2, yproj1, and yproj2 are the projections of the ROIs
	  onto the X and Y axes.
	- xlin1, xlin2, ylin1, and ylin2 are the smoothed projections.
